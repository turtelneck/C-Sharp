Car Insurance:
<ul>
	<li>This makes use of the ASP.NET MVC Framework to implement a fully-functioning database for a web-app that allows users to input, view, and edit information (in this case, insurees applying for car insurance). There's also logic that will calculate an insurance quote for users based on their input. Screenshots <a href="https://github.com/turtelneck/C-Sharp/tree/main/CarInsurance">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

What Time Is It In South Sudan:
<ul>
	<li>On top of being an extremely useful way to find out what time it is in South Sudan, which you'll undoubtedly be relieved to have in your life at last, this is an example of a basic MVC web build making use of the TimeZoneInfo system class. It's hosted on Azure at <a href="https://whattimeisitinsouthsudan.azurewebsites.net/">https://whattimeisitinsouthsudan.azurewebsites.net/</a>, for your convenience.</li>
</ul>

Student Database:
<ul>
	<li>This makes use of the Entity Framework to implement a console application with a code-first database connection where students can be added to a database and displayed to the console.</li>
</ul>
